## Lecture 1

### Question 1

Create a one-line expression that achieve the same output as the below with the square bracket notation.

``` python
NBA = dict(
    OklahomaCity="Thunder",
    Dallas="Mavericks",
    Boston="Celtics",
    NewYork="Knicks",
    Denver="Nuggets",
)

retrieve = NBA.get("Toronto", False)
print(retrieve)
```

### Question 2

Given two numbers, a and b, write a function called compare_numbers that returns a string indicating the following:

- If a is greater than b, return "a is greater"
- If b is greater than a, return "b is greater"
- If both numbers are equal, return "a and b are equal"

Use the ternary operator to implement the function.

``` python
def compare_numbers(a, b):
    pass
```

### Question 3

Examine following JS code snippet and re-create the logic
using Python. Implement the logic as a function that accepts secret_word
as a positional parameter and max_attempt as keyword parameter.

``` js
let secret_word = "javascript";
let max_attempt = 5;
do {
    userInput = prompt("Enter the secret word: ");
    max_attempt -= 1;
    console.log(max_attempt)
} while (secret_word != userInput && max_attempt > 0);

```

### Question 4

Based on the following function definition, identify which of the following parameters are positional-only, keyword-only and/or may be positionally or by keyword.

``` python
def processor(value_1, value_2, /, value_3, value_4=False, *, value_5, value_6):
    text = (value_1 + value_2).upper()
    if value_3:
        text += "!"
    if value_4:
        text = list(text)
        text.extend((value_5, value_6))
    return text
```

## Lecture 2

### Question 1

Create a Triangle Class based on the following specifications:

- Two arguments are accepted: 1) List of side lengths; 2) List of angles.
    - Validate 3 side length values and 3 angle values are    provided.
    - All values in the list must be non-zero Int or Float.
    - The angles must add up to 180Â°
    - Hint: Use Property or Descriptor-based attributes.
- Create an Instance method to calculate the perimeter of the triangle.
- Create a Static method to calculate the hypothenuse when supplied with two sides.
- Create a Dunder method to determine if one triangle instance is larger than another based it perimeter.
- Create a Dunder method to generate an iterator based on the side lengths of a specific instance.

### Question 2

Based on the Triangle Class (above), create an Isosceles Triangle Subclass (e.g., two side and two angles are equal). Override and extend any inherited methods as needed.

- Create an Instance Method to determine the height of an isosceles
    triangle.
